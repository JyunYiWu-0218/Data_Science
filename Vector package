memoryview(): https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/memoryview Python Buffer Protocol:

The buffer protocol provides a way to access the internal data of an object. This internal data is a memory array or a buffer.
The buffer protocol allows one object to expose its internal data (buffers) and the other to access those buffers without intermediate copying.
This protocol is only accessible to us at the C-API level and not using our normal codebase.
So, in order to expose the same protocol to the normal Python codebase, memory views are present.
